# AP-COMPSCI-PROJECT
Hello! This is four of my projects from my AP Computer Science A class
This consits of multiple games such as a Wordle Game remake, Maze Game, and a Cross Word Game. Also there is a model that shows John Conways 
Game of Life. 

1. Crossword is a game where there are set words and the player has to guess those words using the hints provided. 
2. Game of Life is the John Conway's model that shows life of a cell. (Not really a game have not implemented feature where mouse is in control). 
3. Maze Game has a player thta must complete three levels while there are minotaurs and traps around. There are a few helpful resources for the player such as a sword and bow. 
4. Wordle Remake like the popular game Wordle it gives you a word that you have to solve for. The characters of all the letters is given and will be blocked out once a word is guessed and not part of the desired word. Plus the letters that are part of the word will stay as is. 

Note: This is code from a beginner so it really isnt complex nor does it have many feature a lot of JOptionPane is used and the occasional JFrame is used. This is meant to be user friendly. Anyone can modify the code to fit their needs this is a source/base code after all. :)
